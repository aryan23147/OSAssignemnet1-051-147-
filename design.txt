Design
First we created a file descriptor of our 32 bit elf file of fib
Then we created space for elf header in memory and then read it value and stored it in our heap memory
After that we checked whetehr our elf file is valid or not using elf header
Then we moved onto the programme headers
We created spac3 for programme headers in our heap memory
We moved our fd to start of programme headers this time more like an array
And then read its value from memory
Then we will identify the segment in which entry point our programme is stored
And then using mmap stored it in a memory from which it can get directly executed
Use the same read func to read its value
Then running that start_func in our programme

Contribution
We both worked together during the work so we both have contributed equally
